## Requirements

You can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:

- You are running Passbolt Pro >= v3.6.0 or Passbolt Cloud.
- You have an active administrator account

## How does it work?

Account recovery is a feature introduced with passbolt v3.6.0 that as for aim to help users to recover their accounts in
case of recovery kit or passphrase loss.

Depending on the organisation policy, all users will be able to deposit an encrypted backup of their private keys in
passbolt. Backups that can only be unlocked cryptographically by the organisation administrators having in their
possession the organisation recovery key.

## Enable account recovery

To enable account recovery for your organization, navigate to the account recovery administration page: *
Administration > Account recovery*.

### Choose the organisation policy

By default, the feature is disabled. To enable it, choose among the proposed policies the one that best suits your
organization.

- __Mandatory__: as its name states, users have to subscribe to the program no matter their preferences. New users will
  be forced to subscribe to the program while registering for the first time while existing users will be prompted to
  subscribe after signing in to the application.
- __Opt-out__: users have the choice to subscribe or reject the program, but they are subscribed by default. Users will
  be able to set their preferences while registering for the first time while existing users will be prompted to
  subscribe after signing in to the application.
- __Opt-in__: as the *opt-out* option, users have the choice to subscribe or reject the program, but they are not
  subscribed by default. New users will be able to set their preferences while registering for the first time and
  existing users will be able to set their preference via their settings workspace.
- __Disable__: as the name states, the program is disabled and nobody will be able to use it.

### Set the organisation key

Once you have chosen the organisation policy the next step is to set an organisation key. This key will be used to
encrypt the escrow of the organisation users private keys.

#### Import the organisation key

This method is the recommended one as it will keep your organisation key isolated from passbolt until the moment you
need it.

In order to be accepted, the organisation key should meet these requirements:

- The key should be public gpg key
- The key should use the algorithm RSA
- The key should have a length of 4096 bits
- The key should have a passphrase

:::info
If you do not know how to generate an OpenPGP key, checkout the following
documentation: [how to generate an OpenPGP key](/admin/faq/generate-openpgp-key/).
:::

#### Generate the organisation key

If you cannot generate an OpenPGP key on your own, we got your back. In the import recovery key dialog, click on the
“Generate” tab. From there you will find a tool that will help you to generate your organisation key.

:::caution
Passbolt will prompt you to save the generated key on your computer. Keep this backup offline in a safe place, it will
be required later to update the organisation policy as well as to approve users' recovery requests.
:::

### Activate the policy

Once the account recovery policy is configured and its key is set, click "Save settings" to activate the policy.
