Passbolt Pro Edition since v2.4 and CE since v3.9 support TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) as a multi factor authentication option.

TOTP is a type of authentication method that generates a new, unique password at set intervals (such as every 30 seconds) to be used in addition to another authentication method (such as username and password).

Multi Factor Authentication requires HTTPS to work.

## Security considerations

When using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) as a form of multi-factor authentication, it is recommended to set up at least one additional multi-factor authentication method as a backup. Should the TOTP service experience downtime, this measure guarantees that users can continue to access their accounts despite the malfunction of one authentication method.

Another consideration involves ensuring accurate time synchronization between the server and client devices. Without this, TOTP codes may not align, leading to authentication failures.

## Install a TOTP application

To use this authentication service, users must install an application that supports Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), such as Google Authenticator or FreeOTP. Throughout this page, we will focus on the Google Authenticator mobile application, compatible with smartphones and tablets.

- [Google Authenticator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) on google play store.
- [Google Authenticator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) on apple store.

## Enable TOTP access

To enable TOTP for the organization, navigate to the multi-factor authentication administration page: *Administration > Multi Factor Authentication*. Subsequently, enable the "Time-based One Time Password" provider by moving the adjacent toggle to the on position. Ensure you save these modifications to activate the provider.

## Setup TOTP as a user

To setup TOTP as multi-factor authentication method, navigate to the multi-factor authentication user settings page: *Avatar > Profil > Multi Factor Authentication*. Next, you should be able to select the provider "TOTP Authenticator".

Upon clicking on your provider, you will be presented with a short visual guide on how the feature operates, followed by an invitation to "Get Started!".

The next step will show a QR code that you can scan with the Google Authenticator app. This app will then produce a six-digit code that refreshes every 30 seconds. Input this code into Passbolt and click on "Validate" to ensure it functions correctly and complete the setup.

## Authenticate with TOTP

After setting up TOTP, each time you sign-in to Passbolt, you'll need to enter the six-digit code from the Google Authenticator app. Additionally, if permitted by the "Multi-factor Authentication Policy", Passbolt can remember your MFA authentication for a month.
