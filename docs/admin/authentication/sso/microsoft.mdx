Since version 3.9, Passbolt Pro Edition supports SSO with Microsoft via Azure AD.

## How does it work?

In short Passbolt SSO leverages Azure OAuth2/OpenID on top of the existing [challenge-based authentication](https://help.passbolt.com/api/authentication). The user by logging in Microsoft unlocks a key stored server side needed to decrypt the secret key passphrase twice encrypted with a non-extractable symetric key stored in the browser extension local storage client side.

To understand which user flows are supported currently, the risk analysis, and how it works in practice please read the [developer documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S58TonJ2uXwkaKl7WwLzTzmwJGiSJdhlqP-xbmxFBd0/edit).

## How to configure the plugin?

:::warning[Attention]
This feature requires HTTPS to work.
:::

Open both the Azure portal and Passbolt:

* You will need to go the administration section of your Passbolt instance and then to the “Single Sign On” section.
* You will need to also login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

/>

You must ensure users are present both in passbolt and Azure AD, the email is used to correlate accounts.

* Users that are not present in Azure AD but are present in passbolt will not be able to use SSO (a message on microsoft side will be shown).
* Users that are not present in passbolt but are present in Azure AD will not be able to login in passbolt (a message on passbolt side will be shown).

### Configure Azure AD

In your Azure AD portal:

* Go to Azure Directory service (or set one up)
  * Make sure your user email in Azure Directory matches the one in [assbolt
* Copy your Tenant ID (a UUID) and paste it in passbolt
* Go to App Registrations > New registration OR "+ Add" > "App Registration"

/>

Register a new application

* Give it a Name such as "Passbolt SSO"
* Select the supported account type you desire. "Accounts in this organizational directory only" is a good default.
* Copy the redirect url from Passbolt to Azure, it should be something like `https://yourdomain.com/sso/azure/redirect`.
* In "Select a platform", select "Web"
* Click register, you should be back on the Azure application page
* Copy the application (client) ID back to your passbolt instance

Add a secret for the application

* On the Azure application page, click on "Certificate and secrets"
* Click on "New client secret"
* Choose a name like "Passbolt SSO Secret"
* Select an expiry date
* Copy the secret value and expiry back to your passbolt instance

/>

In your passbolt instance:

* Click save settings
* A dialog will open with Microsoft button, click on it
* A popup will open asking you to perform the authentication with Microsoft
* Once the authentication is successful you can save the settings
* Once the settings have been saved, you can log out, you should then see an SSO option

Please note that users must successfully perform a login using their current passphrase _after SSO has been activated_ in order for the SSO option to be proposed to them at future logins.
