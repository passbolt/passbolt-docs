## How does it work?

In short Passbolt SSO leverages Entra ID OAuth2/OpenID on top of the existing [challenge-based authentication](https://help.passbolt.com/api/authentication). The user by logging in Microsoft unlocks a key stored server side needed to decrypt the secret key passphrase twice encrypted with a non-extractable symmetric key stored in the browser extension local storage client side.

To understand which user flows are supported currently, the risk analysis, and how it works in practice please read the [developer documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S58TonJ2uXwkaKl7WwLzTzmwJGiSJdhlqP-xbmxFBd0/edit).

## How to configure the plugin?

<EmailMatchingWarning />

Open both the Entra admin center and Passbolt:

* You will need to go the administration section of your Passbolt instance and then to the "Single Sign On" section.
* You will need to also login to the [Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).

You must ensure users are present both in Passbolt and Entra ID, the email is used to correlate accounts.

* Users that are not present in Entra ID but are present in Passbolt will not be able to use SSO (a message on Microsoft side will be shown).
* Users that are not present in Passbolt but are present in Entra ID will not be able to login in Passbolt (a message on Passbolt side will be shown).

### Configure Entra ID

In your Entra ID portal:

* Go to *Identity > Overview* from the left panel menu.
  * Make sure your user email in Azure Directory matches the one in Passbolt
* Copy your Tenant ID (a UUID) and paste it in Passbolt
* Click on *Add > App registration*

Register a new application

* Give it a Name such as "Passbolt SSO"
* Select the supported account type you desire. "Accounts in this organizational directory only" is a good default.
* Copy the redirect url from Passbolt to Entra, it should be something like `https://yourdomain.com/sso/azure/redirect`.
* In "Select a platform", select "Web"
* Click register, you should be back on the Entra application page
* Copy the application (client) ID back to your Passbolt instance

Add a secret for the application

* On the Entra application page, click on "Certificate and secrets"
* Click on "New client secret"
* Choose a name like "Passbolt SSO Secret"
* Select an expiry date
* Copy the secret value and expiry back to your Passbolt instance

In your Passbolt instance:

* Click save settings
* A dialog will open with Microsoft button, click on it
* A popup will open asking you to perform the authentication with Microsoft
* Once the authentication is successful you can save the settings
* Once the settings have been saved, you can log out, you should then see an SSO option

Please note that users must successfully perform a login using their current passphrase _after SSO has been activated_ in order for the SSO option to be proposed to them at future logins.
