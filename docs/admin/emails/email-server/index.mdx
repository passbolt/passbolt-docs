## Introduction

Passbolt relies heavily on emails:

- Account creation
- Account recovery
- Notifications on different user actions

Having a working email setup is essential if you want to use passbolt at its best. There are many email providers
and each one has its own setup process. The aim of this help page is to provide the basic concepts so each admin
can setup their provider adjusting to their particular case.

## Requirements

You can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:

- You are running Passbolt Pro > 3.8.0 or Passbolt Cloud
- You have an active administrator account

[You are running Passbolt Pro < 3.7.3 ?](#configure-smtp-with-passbolt-373-or-earlier-version)

## How does it work?

Configuring the email server through the UI is a feature introduced with Passbolt v3.8.0 to help all administrators manage their SMTP server settings easily.

We moved the email configuration from `config/passbolt.php` directly into the database and your credentials are encrypted with the server GPG public key.

## Access to email server configuration

In order to configure your email server configuration, go to administration setting workspace.

*Administration > Email server*

### Choose your email provider

When you consult your email server settings for the first time, by default, the provider is **Other**. Everything is filled out except logins details. You are free to edit thoses fields to match your email configuration.

/>

We also provide pre-filled configuration for the SMTP providers listed below.

But still, you can navigate through *advanced settings* to change all the setings like *SMTP host*, *TLS*, and *port*.

#### Configure email authentication with your SMTP provider

<ProviderCardWrapper providers={smtpProviders}/>

### Save the settings

To save the settings, you have to click on the *save settings* button.

<Figure

  caption="Email Server - Save configuration"
  alt="Email Server - Save configuration"
/>

If at least one mandatory field is empty or doesn’t have the expected format, an error alert will appears and the interface jumps to the first mandatory field that doesn’t fit the requirements. This field will also shows an error message in red.

### Test email notifications

You can test your configuration by clicking on the *send test email* button. You must enter a valid recipient email to start the test procedure but the administrator current email is pre-filled.

If the email has been successfully sent and you haven't received anything you should check your spam folder.
The logs are also available in a text area if you unfolds the logs section.

## Configure SMTP server using custom/self-signed certificate

With the v4.7 release, we have introduced support for SMTP servers using self-signed certificates.

You can set SSL/TLS options in your `passbolt.php` or environment variables to specify your custom root CA certificate or skip verification (not recommended).

### Allow self-signed certificate verification

```php
// config/passbolt.php

return [
    'passbolt' => [
        ...

        'plugins' => [
            ...

            'smtpSettings' => [
                ...
                'security' => [
                    'sslVerifyPeer' => true,
                    'sslVerifyPeerName' => true,
                    'sslAllowSelfSigned' => true, // default = false
                    'sslCafile' => '/path/to/ca.crt'
                ],
            ],

            ...

        ],

        ...
    ],
];
```

Or, you can also use environment variables:

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_VERIFY_PEER=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_VERIFY_PEER_NAME=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_CAFILE="/path/to/ca.crt"
```

### Skip TLS/SSL verification

The approach of skipping TLS/SSL verification is *not recommended* but can be useful if you want to test if you are able to connect to your SMTP server.

```php
// config/passbolt.php

return [
    'passbolt' => [
        ...

        'plugins' => [
            ...

            'smtpSettings' => [
                ...
                'security' => [
                    'sslVerifyPeer' => false, // default true
                    'sslVerifyPeerName' => false, // default true
                    'sslAllowSelfSigned' => true, // default false
                ],
            ],

            ...

        ],

        ...
    ],
];
```

Or, via environment variables:

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_VERIFY_PEER=false
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_VERIFY_PEER_NAME=false
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_SMTP_SETTINGS_SECURITY_SSL_ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED=true
```

## Configure SMTP with Passbolt 3.7.3 or earlier version

### TLS email providers

If your email provider supports TLS encryption your setup should look like this in `config/passbolt.php`:

```bash
    'EmailTransport' => [
        'default' => [
            'host' => 'your.smtp.provider.host.com',
            'port' => 587,
            'username' => 'user',
            'password' => 'secret',
            'tls' => true,
        ],
    ],
```

You should replace:

- your.smtp.provider.host.com
- user
- secret

With the actual values for your provider.
Usually email providers that support TLS use port 587 however you should check with your provider specific
requirements.

### SSL email providers

Some providers support SSL encryption and the setup is slightly different from the TLS case. Just change
your *`config/passbolt.php`* file to look like this:

```bash
    'EmailTransport' => [
        'default' => [
            'host' => 'ssl://your.smtp.provider.host.com',
            'port' => 465,
            'username' => 'user',
            'password' => 'secret',
            'tls' => null,
        ],
    ],
```

All the changes are the same as the TLS providers except that you will set **tls** to null and replace placeholders with the actual values for your provider.
