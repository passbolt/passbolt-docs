When an user that configured MFA lose his access, it is still possible to help him as an administrator and a system administrator.

# Interface

In the *users* workspace, as an administrator, it is possible to right click on the user and Disable MFA.

<Figure

    '/img/help/2025/04/disable-mfa.png'
  }
  alt={'Disable MFA from the users workspace'}
  caption={'fig. Disable MFA from the users workspace'}
/>


# Server

In the passbolt database, it is possible with an SQL query to deactivate MFA for the user

<CodeBlock>
{`SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE username='USERNAME';`}
</CodeBlock>

The placeholder **USERNAME** should be replaced with the user's email address, then copy the identifier output e.g. `20f11ac2-eabd-4e83-8ddb-0752934ca119`


Then, replace the placeholder **ID** with the copied output, run the SQL query below and it should be done!
<CodeBlock>
{`DELETE FROM account_settings WHERE user_id='ID' AND property='mfa';`}
</CodeBlock>
