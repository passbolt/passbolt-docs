# Metadata Key

This section controls the layer of encryption that is used to protect metadata such as the name of a resource, URIs, Custom Fields, and all fields defined in [Allow Content Types](./allowed-content-types.mdx).

## Overview

The Metadata Key settings allow administrators to:
- Generate the organization's shared metadata key
- Control the policy regarding the privacy of resources that are not shared

:::important
A metadata key should be enabled to allow users to create resources with encrypted metadata.
:::

## Configuration Options

### Metadata Key Policy

Choose one of the following modes:

#### Allow the use of personal keys (recommended)

Personal (non-shared) resources metadata are encrypted with the user's OpenPGP key. Shared content uses the shared key.

Use these settings if you want to:
- Offer maximum privacy to your users
- Not allow the organizations to access their personal resources metadata

Note that with these settings, the personal resources of the users won't be auditable.

#### Enforce the use of shared metadata keys

All metadata is encrypted using the shared metadata key. Personal keys are not used for metadata encryption under this policy.

Use these settings if you need auditability on all resources stored in Passbolt.

:::warning
If you try to save the page with "Enforce use of shared metadata keys" set but haven't generated a metadata key yet, you'll receive an error message.

### Zero Knowledge (Coming soon)

This setting allows administrators to define the way the shared metadata key will be distributed to end-users.

#### User-Friendly Mode (coming soon)

The API will have access to the shared metadata key in order to distribute it to users when they are registering for the first time.

Benefits:
- Prioritizes onboarding ease
- Still protects against database breach

Limitations:
- Not full zero-knowledge as it does not protect the metadata information in case of API breach

#### Zero-Knowledge Mode (coming soon)

The API does not have access to the shared metadata key, and the API won't be able to share it with users after they registered.

Requirements:
- Administrators will have to manually share the metadata key after a user registered
- Key rotation is advised when switching modes

Benefits:
- Protects against database and API breach

### Shared Metadata Keys

To generate a shared metadata key:

1. Navigate to Organisation settings > Content types > Metadata key
2. Click "Generate key"
3. Click "Save" to confirm the key creation

:::note
The generated key is only 'Pending' until the page is saved.
:::

## Key Information

After generating a key, detailed information about the shared metadata key is shown:

| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Fingerprint** | DC6A 4B28 58CF 2C58 6859<br/>C505 7DEB 3F99 EE06 979B |
| **Algorithm** | eddsa ed25519 |
| **Key length** | 256 |
| **Created** | 30 days ago |

## Important Considerations

:::important
A shared metadata key is required to enable any metadata encrypted resources as shared resources require the shared key.
:::

To fully implement encrypted metadata:
1. Generate a metadata key on this page
2. Configure the encryption settings in [Encrypted Metadata](./encrypted-metadata.mdx)
3. Enable the desired content types in [Allow Content Types](./allowed-content-types.mdx)
4. Migrate existing resources using [Migrate Metadata](./migrate-metadata.mdx) if needed
