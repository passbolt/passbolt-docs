## Color-coded legend

You will see on the right side that we've introduced a color-coded legend.
- Green: OK ✅
- Orange: OK after ensuring it is 🔍
- Red: Something is not OK. 🚨
- Blue: This is just for information. ✏️

## What could trigger an error?

### Environment
These checks are related to the environment itself e.g. **PHP version, PHP module**, etc.

#### Kernel
The kernel version check ensures that your system is running a modern and stable Linux kernel. A recent and maintained kernel version helps provide security updates, bug fixes, and compatibility with required software dependencies.

#### System architecture
This checks whether your system is running on a 64-bit architecture. A 64-bit system provides better performance, allowing full compatibility with PHP and GPG requirements.

#### PHP Version
It helps to ensure you are not running an unsupported PHP version. It should be green if you are running PHP > 8.2 as it is the minimum version recommended to run Passbolt.

However, with the upcoming Passbolt v5, if you are still on PHP 7.4 we recommend [migrating to a new server](/docs/hosting/migrate/server/) already to ensure a smooth future update.

#### Gnupg Version
The software relies on gnupg for cryptographic operations, such as key management and encryption. Ensuring that you are running an up-to-date version of GPG is essential for security and performance.

#### PCRE

You should not face any compiling issues with PCRE by default, however if PCRE has not been completed with unicode support, while reconfiguring you should add:

<CodeBlock>
  {`--enable-unicode-properties`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Temporary directory
The temporary directory and its content should be writable and not executable, if you see some errors you should ensure that the temporary directory and its content are writable by the webserver user.

<WebServerLocationWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/passbolt/tmp
sudo chmod -R 775 $(find /var/lib/passbolt/tmp -type d)
sudo chmod -R 664 $(find /var/lib/passbolt/tmp -type f)`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Logs directory
The logs directory and its content have to be writable, if you see some error there is a high chance that it is not the case yet.

<WebServerLocationWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/passbolt
sudo chmod -R 775 $(find /var/log/passbolt -type d)
sudo chmod -R 664 $(find /var/log/passbolt -type f)`}
</CodeBlock>

#### GD or Imagick
GD **or** Imagick module have to be installed in order for Passbolt to manipulate images. If you have some errors with this check, you can take a look at [this documentation](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)

#### Intl
The Intl module is needed for the internationalisation. If you have any error with this check, you should take a look [this documentation](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php)

#### Mbstring
Mbstring is designed for safe and efficient handling of multibyte strings, allowing Passbolt to work with textual data in various encodings. If you encounter some errors related to this module, you can take a look at [this documentation](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php)

#### NTP
The server requires accurate system time for cryptographic operations and security measures. If the system clock is not synchronized, it may lead to authentication errors, expiration issues, and other unexpected behavior.

If the check fails, it means that NTP could be inactive, and your system clock may not be synchronized. You can take a look at our [dedicated documentation](/docs/hosting/configure/ntp/) for that.
### Config Files
:::tip[PRO TIP]
If you are on Docker or Helm, you should not manually iterate on the configuration files. Restarting the container or the pod should resolve the file conflicts except if they have been mounted.
:::
This section is there to ensure that both application and Passbolt configuration file are present.

#### Application Configuration File

This file is critical for the application, if it is missing, you should do a copy of the default file.
<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo cp /etc/passbolt/app.default.php /etc/passbolt/app.php`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Passbolt Configuration File
This is the Passbolt configuration file, it is needed to ensure that Passbolt have been completely configured.

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo cp /etc/passbolt/passbolt.default.php /etc/passbolt/passbolt.php`}
</CodeBlock>

### Core config
These verification are for the basic application settings, such as URL and security configurations, are properly set and operational.
#### Debug mode
We highly not recommend to use the debug mode on a prod or pre-prod environment. If you see **Debug mode is on**, update the configuration file in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* and set debug to false.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/disable_debug_mode.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Disable debug mode"
  alt="Disable debug mode"
/>

#### Cache
It verifies that the cache mechanism is working, this can help with performances issues. If the cache is somehow not working, you should consider taking a look at the settings in */etc/passbolt/app.php*

#### Unique value for security.salt
It helps to ensure that the **security.salt** value used for the hash is unique and correctly configured. If you have any error you will need to edit the `security.salt` in */etc/passbolt/app.php*

#### Full Base URL
:::info
If you are on Docker or Helm, you will need to set the `APP_FULL_BASE_URL` environment variable.
:::

Helps to confirm that the fullBaseUrl is defined, if it is not defined yet, you will need to edit `App.fullBaseUrl` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/update-fullbaseurl.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Update the fullBaseUrl in the Passbolt configuration file"
  alt="Update the fullBaseUrl in the Passbolt configuration file"
/>

#### Full Base URL validation
It checks that the fullBaseUrl is correct and match the expectation, if there is any error with the validation here is the two things you might want to do:
- Edit `App.fullBaseUrl` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*
- Select a valid domain name as defined by section 2.3.1 [here](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt)

#### Healthcheck Status
It checks that the status url is reachable. If you have any error with this check, the good news is that this warning should not limit you for running Passbolt, however, in order to get rid of this warning, you will need to ensure a few things:
- `App.fullBaseUrl` is correct inside */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* or with the environment variable `APP_FUL_BASE_URL` if you are on Docker or Helm.
- The server is able to ping the domain with `ping YOUR_DOMAIN`

If the server is not able to ping the domain, this might the cause of the issues, you will need to edit the */etc/hosts* file and add the domain resolution.
<CodeBlock>
  {`127.0.0.1      YOUR_DOMAIN`}
</CodeBlock>

### SSL Certificate
These checks verify that the SSL certificate is valid and correctly configured to secure communications.

#### Peer certificate
This check helps to ensure that the certificate is still valid, if this check is failing there is three potential reasons:
- The certificate is expired
- It's a self-signed certificate that is not trusted on the server.
- It's a wildcard certificate

Since the certificate is not validating the hostname when using a wildcard, we are throwing an error but if you are confident with the certificate and your configuration, you can consider this as a false negative.

:::info
The location of the trusted certificated depends on the distribution, for this example it uses Debian.
:::

In order to trust the certificate on the server, you will need to create a `cert.crt` file which contain the chain of trust of the certificate (more information available [here](/hosting/troubleshooting/ssl-tls/)) and move this file in */usr/share/ca-certificates*

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo cp cert.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/cert.crt
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates`}
</CodeBlock>

Then you will see three options, we recommend choosing **ask** and manually approve the imported certificate.

The domain resolution should be also completed in */etc/hosts/* file

<CodeBlock>
  {`127.0.0.1   YOUR_DOMAIN`}
</CodeBlock>


#### Hostname
It verifies that the hostname from the certificate match `App.fullBaseUrl` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* or the environment variable `APP_FULL_BASE_URL`

#### Self-signed certificate check
It helps to identify if you are using a self-signed certificate or not, this is likely a warning and should not be considered as a failure if you are confident with your certificate configuration.

### Database
The database checks ensure that the application can connect to the database and that the necessary tables and default content are present.

#### Connection to the database

:::tip[PRO TIP]
If you are on Docker or Helm, you might want to double-check the values for `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_*`. More information available [here](/docs/hosting/configure/environment-reference/)
:::

It helps to ensure that the application is able to connect to the database. If you encounter some issues with this check, there is a few potentials reasons:
- Ensure that the driver defined for `Datasources.default.driver` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* is one of the following:
  - 'Cake\Database\Driver\Mysql'
  - 'Cake\Database\Driver\Postgres'
- Double-check that the database credentials for `Datasources.default` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*
- Make sure that the database exists and is accessible for the given database user
- Make sure that the database is reachable from the server

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/database-credentials.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Database credentials configuration"
  alt="Database credentials configuration"
/>


#### Numbers of table
It checks that the necessary tables exists in the database. If there is any error with this checks, you should run the installation scripts to install the database tables.

<WebServerWarning />

<PassboltInstall />


#### Default content
Ensure that default content are present in the database. If there is any error, you should consider running the installation script ot install the database tables.

<WebServerWarning />

<PassboltInstall />

### GPG Configuration
These checks helps to confirm the correct setup and functionality of GPG keys used for encrypting and signing messages. This is critical for Passbolt to work properly.

#### GPG Module
It ensure that the GPG module for PHP is installed and loaded, if it is not the case and you are seeing an error there is two things to be considered.
- Install [php-gnupg](https://php.net/manual/en/gnupg.installation.php)
- Make sure to add `extension=gnupg` in the */path/to/php.ini* configuration files for both php-cli and php.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/add-gnupg-to-php.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Add the gnupg extension to php.ini"
  alt="Add the gnupg extension to php.ini"
/>

#### GNUPGHOME
This check helps to verify that the variable GNUPGHOME is set and point to the right directory. If you have any errors, you should ensure the keyring location exists and is accessible by the webserver user.

<WebServerKeyringWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg`}
</CodeBlock>

You can also change the location of the keyring by editing the `GPG.env.setenv` and `GPG.env.home` variable in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*.

#### GPG Keyring
It helps to ensure that the keyring is writable by the webserver, if you face any error please consider running these commands

<WebServerKeyringWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg`}
</CodeBlock>


#### Server Public Key
It helps to ensure that the server public key is defined and readable. If you face any error there is few potentials things to do:
- Ensure the public key file is defined by the variable `passbolt.gpg.serverKey.public` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*
- Ensure there is a public key armored block in the key file.
- Ensure the public key defined in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* exists and is accessible by the webserver user.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/serverkeys.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Ensure the public key is defined"
  alt="Ensure the public key is defined"
/>

#### Server Private Key
It helps to ensure that the server private key is defined and readable. If you face any error there is few potentials things to do:
- Ensure the private key file is defined by the variable `passbolt.gpg.serverKey.private` in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*
- Ensure there is a private key armored block in the key file.
- Ensure the private key defined in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* exists and is accessible by the webserver user.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/serverkeys.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Ensure the private key is defined"
  alt="Ensure the private key is defined"
/>

#### Server Key Fingerprint
It checks that the fingerprint from the server key match the one defined in the configuration file or environment variable. If you face any errors double-check the key fingerprint.

<WebServerKeyringWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "gpg --list-keys --fingerprint --home /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg" www-data | grep -i -B 2 SERVER_KEY_EMAIL`}
</CodeBlock>

Replace `SERVER_KEY_EMAIL` with the email you've used when you generated the server key.

#### Server key in the keyring
It checks that the server public key is present in the keyring. If it is not in the keyring, you should import the private server key in the keyring of the webserver user.

<WebServerKeyringWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "gpg --home /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg --import /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey_private.asc" www-data`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Server Email Id
This will ensure that the `emailId` related to the server keys is valid, if there is an error please edit or generate another key with a valid `emailId`.

#### Encryption check for Public Key
Checks that the server public key can be used to encrypt a message, if there is any issues with this check there is multiple things to consider:
- Make sure that the server private key is valid and that there is no passphrase.
- Make sure you imported the private server key in the keyring of the webserver user.

<WebServerWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "gpg --home /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg --import /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey_private.asc" www-data`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Signing check for Public Key
This check help to ensure that the server public key can be used to sign a message, if there is any issues with this check there is multiple things to consider:
- Make sure that the server public key is valid and that there is no passphrase.
- Make sure you imported the public server key in the keyring of the webserver user.

<WebServerWarning />

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "gpg --home /var/lib/passbolt/.gnupg --import /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey.asc" www-data`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Encryption and signing check for Private and Public Keys
<DockerEnvTips />

It helps to ensure that both the private key and the public key can be used to encrypt and sign a message, if there is any error with this you might consider generate new keys.


#### Decryption and verification for Private Key
<DockerEnvTips />

It helps to ensure that the private key can be used to decrypt and verify a message, if there is any error with this you might consider generate new keys.


#### Verification for Public Key
<DockerEnvTips />

It helps to ensure that the public key can be used to verify a message, if there is any error with this you might consider generate new keys.


#### Gopengpg compatibility for Public Key
It ensures that the public server key format is compatible with Gopengpg, errors are usually related to the format. Remove all empty new lines above the end block line

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/end_pgp_public.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Remove above end of public key block line"
  alt="Remove above end of public key block line"
/>

#### Gopengpg compatibility for Private Key
Ensure that the private server key format is compatible with Gopengpg, errors are usually related to the format. Remove all empty new lines above the end block line

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/end_pgp_private.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Remove above end of private key block line"
  alt="Remove above end of private key block line"
/>

### Application configuration
These verifications validate various application settings, including SSL enforcement, versioning, and plugin configurations.

#### Passbolt version
It helps to identify which version are running and if it is the latest version. You could face some errors while having an updated version if the server is in an air gap environment and it could not connect to the Passbolt repository to check versions.

If the server is not up-to-date, unless you have an internal good reason, please consider [updating](/docs/hosting/update) to the latest version.

#### Force SSL
We recommend using SSL with Passbolt, this checks verify if Passbolt has been configured to force SSL. If you have this error, you will need to set `passbolt.ssl.force` to true in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/force-ssl.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Add forcing SSL to the Passbolt configuration file"
  alt="Add forcing SSL to the Passbolt configuration file"
/>

#### Full Base URL HTTPS
This is verifying if Passbolt is running in HTTPS. If you have an issues and think it is an error please consider checking `App.fullBaseUrl` scheme in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* or the environment variable set for `APP_FULL_BASE_URL` if you are on Docker or Helm.

#### Selenium API endpoints
Selenium API endpoints are disabled by default and should remain disabled. This setting should be used for testing only. If you have it enabled, you should set `passbolt.selenium.active` to false in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/disable-selenium-endpoints.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Disable Selenium API endpoints"
  alt="Disable Selenium API endpoints"
/>

#### Search engine robots
Ensure that the search engine robots are configured to not index the content, if it is not the case, set `passbolt.meta.robots` to false in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/search-engine-robots.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Disable Search Engine Robots"
  alt="Disable Search Engine Robots"
/>

#### Self Registration Plugin
Enabled by default, it check if the self registration plugin is enabled as expected. You can disable the plugin in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* through `passbolt.plugins.selfRegistration.enabled` and set it to false.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/disable-self-registration-plugin.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Disable Self Registration Plugin"
  alt="Disable Self Registration Plugin"
/>

#### Registration Closed
This check is following the self registration plugin. It checks if the open registration is closed and only the admins are allowed to create users or if the self registration plugin is enabled and it has been configured in the user interface through *Administration > Self registration*. You should be able to see which self registration provider is set.

#### Deprecated self registration public settings
This check ensure that the self registration public settings are not present in the Passbolt configuration file in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*, if it is still there you may remove the `passbolt.registration.public` settings.

#### Host availability
The Passbolt server will verify the email domain names. This means that Passbolt will query DNS for an MX record associated with the email addresses used. **This is disabled by default**.

When it is enabled, it won't be possible to proceed to a user creation using a local email address, if you are confident about using trusted email domain addresses, you may want to enable it.

- Set `PASSBOLT_EMAIL_VALIDATE_MX` environment variable to true if you are on Docker or Helm
- Set `passbolt.email.validate.mx` to true in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/host_availability.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Enable host availability"
  alt="Enable host availability"
/>

#### Compiled version of the javascript application
It will ensure that the compiled version of the application is served, you should not face any errors, however if there is any, you should set `passbolt.js.build` to production in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* otherwise Passbolt will be slower.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/serve_js_app.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Serve compiled version of javascript"
  alt="Serve compiled version of javascript"
/>

#### Email notifications
It checks if some email notifications are disabled by the administrator, this just there as a warning. **This is usually a good practice to monitor the email notifications**.

### SMTP Settings
These SMTP settings checks ensure that the configuration is working for sending emails are correctly configured and operational.
#### SMTP Settings Plugin
Ensure that the SMTP plugin is enabled. It is enabled by default in order to configure the SMTP settings through the user interface in *Administration > Email server*.

#### SMTP Settings Configuration
This check helps to ensure that the SMTP settings are coherent. If there is any error, it will be displayed.

#### SMTP Settings Source
Display which SMTP settings source are used, e.g. through the configuration file in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*, environment variables if you are on Docker or Helm or through the interface which is the database. It should be using **database** by default.

#### SMTP Settings endpoints
It helps to verify that the SMTP plugins endpoints are enabled, this is needed in order to configure the SMTP settings through the user interface, **this is enabled by default**.

### Directory Sync
It verifies that the endpoints for synchronizing user directory configurations are enabled and functioning.

This is needed in order to configure LDAP through the user interface in *Administration > Users Directory* instead of using */etc/passbolt/ldap.php* which is only recommended if you are using multiple LDAP servers to synchronize the trees structure.

If you are not using LDAP with Passbolt, you can disable this plugin through */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php* with `passbolt.security.directorySync.endpointsDisabled` or with the environment variable `PASSBOLT_SECURITY_DIRECTORY_SYNC_ENDPOINTS_DISABLED` if you are on Docker or Helm.

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2024/06/disable_ldap.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Disable LDAP Plugin"
  alt="Disable LDAP Plugin"
/>

### SSO
This help with the SSL certification validation for the Single Sign-On (SSO) instance is enabled and properly configured. There is a few things to consider if you are manually disabling it.
- Disabling the SSL verification check can lead to security attacks.
  - Attacker can alter the certificate and can perform man-in-the-middle attack.

If you want to fix this, set `PASSBOLT_SECURITY_SSO_SSL_VERIFY` environment variable to true if you are on Docker or Helm or set `passbolt.security.sso.sslVerify` to true in */etc/passbolt/passbolt.php*.
