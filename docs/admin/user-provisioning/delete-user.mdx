## What happens when you delete a user who owns non-shared resources?

When you delete a user who owns non-shared resources, those resources belonging solely to the user will also be deleted.
Unlike shared resources, they won't be retained.

## What happens when you delete a user who is sole owner of a shared resource?

When a user, sole owner of a resource, is about to be deleted, a popup window is displayed and Passbolt admin will
be asked to transfer ownership of the resource to the group or user. If the deleted user was also the sole group manager,
passbolt admin will promote another user of the group as group manager.
