## Who can create a group in Passbolt?

Only a Passbolt administrator can create groups on Passbolt.

## What is the difference between a group manager and group member?

The group manager is a group member who can add or delete users to a given group, and promote them as another
group manager. No more, no less.

It is possible for a group member to share a resource he owns in “read-only” mode with the group. Group manager
doesn’t have extra-rights to edit resources ownership.
