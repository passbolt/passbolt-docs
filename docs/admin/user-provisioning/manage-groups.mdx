## Who can create a group in passbolt?

Only a passbolt administrator can create groups on passbolt.

## What is the difference between a group manager and group member?

The group manager is a group member who can add or delete users to a given group, and promote them as another
group manager. No more, no less.

It is possible for a group member to share a resource he owns in “read-only” mode with the group. Group manager
doesn’t have extra-rights to edit resources ownership.

## How do I add or edit users access in a group?

Only group managers may edit group members. This can be done with a specific group where you have the group manager role via the *Settings button* > *Manage Users and Groups*. Select the 3-dots button on the group you wish to modify in the sidebar then hit *Edit* to access the user sharing menu. Here you may edit access to the group for existing users, and add access for additional users by utilising the search function. Note that multiple group managers can be assigned.
