A string is available for translation only if it has been externalized in the source code of the Passbolt applications,
and the source code is already in the pre-release state.

:::note
As mentioned in the introduction of this document, British English is the language used to develop the
application. Therefore, any changes to the source language will have to be done in the source code and each change
will have to go through the translation process.

## Externalize styleguide strings

The [styleguide repository](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_styleguide) contains most of the screens presented to
the end user.

In this repository you will find:
* Most of the Passbolt front-end application in the directory *src/react-extension*
* The Passbolt Quickaccess application in the directory *src/react-quickaccess*

The styleguide uses the i18next library to help manage the translation, if you want to know more checkout their
[documentation](https://github.com/i18next/i18next).

### Getting started

In order to work on the translation of this application you need to:
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.
2. Clone it.
3. Install the project dependencies `npm install`.

### Mark a string for translation

To translate a component, this one has first to load the translation context, and optionally the `Trans` component useful
in JSX context.

```javascript
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import React from "react";
import {Trans, withTranslation} from "react-i18next";

class ComponentToTranslate extends React.Component {}

ComponentToTranslate.propTypes = {
  t: PropTypes.func, // The translation function
};
export default withTranslation("common")(ComponentToTranslate);
```

To mark for translation a string contained in JSX code.
```jsx
<Trans>Welcome to Passbolt!</Trans>
```

To mark for translation a string contained in javascript code.
```javascript
this.props.t("Welcome to Passbolt!");
```

### Generate the language json source file

Once you have made your changes on the source code, you can then generate the language json source file.
```shell
npx grunt externalize-locale-string
```

Once done you can propose your changes as a pull request on the repository.

## Externalize browser extension strings

The [browser extension repository](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_browser_extension) contains the code that
orchestrates the browser extension screens and communicate with the API.

In this repository you will find the browser extension background page in the directory *src/all/background_page*

The browser extension uses the i18next library to help manage the translation, if you want to know more checkout their
[documentation](https://github.com/i18next/i18next).

### Getting started

In order to work on the translation of this application you need to:
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.
2. Clone it.
3. Install the project dependencies `npm install`.

### Mark a string for translation

To translate a string, a file has first to load the Passbolt translation utility located in
`src/all/background_page/sdk/i18n.js`. For instance:
```javascript
const {i18n} = require("./sdk/i18n");
```

To mark for translation a string contained in javascript code.
```javascript
i18n.t("Welcome to Passbolt!");
```

### Generate the language json source file

Once you have made your changes on the source code, you can then generate the language json source file.
```shell
npx grunt externalize-locale-string
```

Once done you can propose your changes as a pull request on the repository.

## Externalize API strings

The [API repository](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_api) contains all the code relative to the API
obviously but also some screens presented to the end users such as the installation wizard.

The Passbolt API uses the CakePHP translation feature to help manage the translation, if you want to know more checkout
their [documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/core-libraries/internationalization-and-localization.html).

### Getting started

In order to work on the translation of this application you need to:
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.
2. Clone it.
3. Install the project dependencies `composer install`.

### Mark a string for translation

To mark for translation a string contained in PHP code.
```php
__('Welcome to Passbolt!');
```

### Generate the language gettext source file

Once you have made your changes on the source code, you can then generate the language gettext source file.
```shell
composer externalize-locale-strings
```

Once done you can propose your changes as a pull request on the repository.
