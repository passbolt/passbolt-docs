## GPGAuth

> GPGAuth is the legacy authentication method, and will eventually be dropped in favor of JWT-based authentication.


### Used headers throughout login process

|Header|Meaning|
|:-|:-|
| `X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response` |  	The challenge response, e.g. the secret the server needed to decrypt. The client compares it with the one stored locally and confirms server's identity. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Progress` | The current login stage. Possible values are `verify`, `stage0`, `stage1`, `complete` and `logout`. |
| `X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token` | An encrypted token sent from the server for the client to decrypt in order to confirm its identity. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Authenticated` | A boolean to tell if you are logged in or not. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Refer` | URI of the last location which triggered the login process. Used to redirect back after a successful login. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Error` | Any information with regards to an authentication error. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Pubkey` | The server public key url. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Logout-Url` | The logout URL. |
| `X-GPGAuth-Version` | GPGAuth version. |

### Multi-step authentication process

When using GPGAuth-based authentication, the whole process is divided in multiple steps, each one with a specific use-case.

#### Stage 0 - Server's identity verification

> This step is optional, although recommended.

In this step, the client challenges the server's identity.

In order to do that, the client generates a challenge token, composed of different parts separated by pipes:

- Protocol version (`gpgauthv1.3.0`)
- Length of UUID (`36`)
- Said UUID
- Protocol version again

An example of said challenge string could be `gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0`.

This challenge token is then encrypted with the sever's public key, obtained with a `GET` request to `/auth/verify.json`.

The total payload for server verification has the following structure:

```json
{
    "data": {
      "gpg_auth": {
        "keyid": "<user's key fingerprint>",
        "server_verify_token": "<pgp_encrypt('gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0', public_server_key)>"
    }
  }
}
```

If the user's key fingerprint is known to the server and the server was able to decrypt and validate the challenge string and its format,
the decrypted challenge string is sent in the reply's `X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response` header.

This proves that the server is really who it says it is.


#### Stage 1 - Getting the challenge for client's private key verification

Now that we verified the server's identity, the server wants to verify our identity.
In order to do that, we need to tell the server who the client claims to be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "gpg_auth": {
      "keyid": "<user's key fingerprint>"
    }
  }
}
```

This payload is then sent in a `POST` request to the `/auth/login.json` endpoint.

The server replies with an encrypted challenge string in the `X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token` header.
This challenge string has the same format that the one described in stage 0.

This challenge string is encrypted with the user's public key and signed with the server's key.

#### Stage 2 - Verifying client's private key verification

Once this challenge string has been decrypted, it has to be sent to the server in a `POST`
request to `/auth/login.json` in a payload such as:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "gpg_auth": {
      "keyid": "<user's key fingerprint>",
      "user_token_result": "<decrypted challenge string such as 'gpgauthv1.3.0|36|b0a39f7a-a09a-47d5-9180-0bb03c91406f|gpgauthv1.3.0'>"
    }
  }
}
```

The server now has validated the client's identity, and sets a few headers in its reply:

- `X-GPGAuth-Authenticated` is set to `true`
- A cookie named `passbolt_session` used for session identification
- A cookie named `csrfToken` that the client needs to send in each subsequent authenticated request as a custom header named: `X-CSRF-Token`

ðŸŽ‰ You are fully authenticated and ready to use the API!


## JWT Authentication

JWT-based authentication is the preferred way to interact with the Passbolt API.

This approach provides as secure, signed, framework-agnostic and cookie-less authentication system.
With this authentication method, keep-alives are a thing of the past, which means less requests and greater battery life for clients, while giving
the server a more precise control over tokens expiry and validity.

JWT-based login is made in only one request, in which both the server and the client's identity is verified and validated.

First, the client creates a challenge token in the form of a client-side generated UUID, and encapsulates it in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "domain": "https://passbolt.local",
  "verify_token": "our UUID challenge token",
  "verify_token_expiry": "<UNIX epoch for our challenge token expiration>"
}
```

This challenge payload is then signed using the client's key, and finally encrypted with the server's key (available at `/auth/verify.json`).

The server then decrypts the payload, checks that the payload's signature is the valid for the `user_id` provided alongside the challenge.
It has now verified and validated the user attempting to log in.

The server then replies with the following payload, encrypted with the user's key:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "domain": "https://passbolt.local",
  "verify_token": "our UUID challenge token",
  "access_token": "<JWT which is then used for authenticating the client>",
  "refresh_token": "a UUID used for getting a new access token once it expired"
}
```

The user can then decrypt this payload and validate that the `verify_token` matches the one sent earlier,
checking that the server was able to decrypt its challenge, and by extension, the server's identity.

ðŸŽ‰ You are fully authenticated and ready to use the API!

If multi-factor authentication is enabled for the user, then client gets a list of MFA providers in the challenge response,
such as `"mfa_providers": ["totp", "yubikey"]`.
The client then has to obtain a MFA token, to be used in conjonction with the `access_token`,
by using the relevant endpoints in order to be fully authenticated.

### Refreshing the token

Once the `access_token` expired, the client needs to obtain a new one from the server.

Each `refresh_token` is to be consumed only once, and a new one is provided with the new `access_token`, in a cookie.

If MFA is enabled for the account, a new `passbolt_mfa` token is also provided as a cookie.

## Multi-factor authentication

Passbolt supports logging in using multi factor authentication (MFA).

Your client will need to cater for these scenarios if the account you are using has MFA enabled.
After login and if MFA is required, or when the current MFA authorization session expires, the current request will be redirected using the HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN code.

The response, which tells you the different MFA providers available, will look something like this:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "id": "7ff2828c-1092-4897-8e0a-1dc64ada889f",
    "status": "error",
    "servertime": 1721207029,
    "action": "4d0c0996-ce30-4bce-9918-9062ab35c542",
    "message": "MFA authentication is required.",
    "url": "/mfa/verify/error.json",
    "code": 403
  },
  "body": {
    "mfa_providers": [
      "totp"
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, you have to make a `POST` request to `https://<your Passbolt instance base URL>/mfa/verify/<provider>.json` with the code provided, in a body such as:

```json
{
  "totp": "635742"
}
```

The MFA token is set through the `passbolt_mfa` cookie.
