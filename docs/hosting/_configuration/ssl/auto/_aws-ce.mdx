import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure/Figure';

Execute this command:

```bash
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure passbolt-ce-server
```

You most likely want to say 'NO' to the mariadb/MySQL setup question and go for the nginx setup

Passbolt Debian and Ubuntu packages currently supports the configuration of nginx. It comes with a default configuration that supports:

- Serve Passbolt on port 80 (http)
- Serve Passbolt on port 443 (https)

The following steps will guide you through the option that uses Let's encrypt method to enable SSL.

After choosing yes you will be prompted with the following dialog where you can choose which method you prefer to configure SSL on nginx:

/>

You will now need to introduce the name of the domain name assigned to your server:

  alt="nginx domain name"
  caption="fig. nginx domain name"
/>

Finally you will need to provide an email address for Let's encrypt to notify you for renewals and other admin info:

  alt="lets encrypt admin email"
  caption="fig. lets encrypt admin email"
/>

If everything goes fine you should see a final message that points you to finish Passbolt configuration:

<Figure

  alt="Success message"
  caption="fig. Success message"
/>

Reload nginx after finish the reconfigure to use the SSL configuration.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Finally, ensure **'fullBaseUrl'** value in **/etc/passbolt/passbolt.php** starts with **https://**.

And that's it you should be able to reach your server on the domain you specified.
