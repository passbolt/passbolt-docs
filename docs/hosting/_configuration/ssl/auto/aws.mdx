:::caution
If you are changing your domain from **HTTP to HTTPS**, you will unlink the browser extension of all the users. Before changing the domain, you must ensure that all the users have a copy of their private key to **[recover their account](/user/start/account-recover/)**.
:::

:::caution Important requirement
This tutorial assumes your machine has a valid domain name assigned in order to work with let's encrypt. If you want to use user provided certificates or self-signed certificates skip to the next section
:::

:::note Note
The configuration does not support serving Passbolt on a subdirectory fashion. For example, scenarios like https://mydomain.com/passbolt are not supported by default
:::

## Edit nginx configuration file

By default, our nginx configuration file ensure all domain names will match with our Passbolt virtual appliance but to obtain a valid Let's Encrypt SSL certificate, you will have to manually set your Passbolt domain name.

Open `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx-passbolt.conf` and search for this line:

```bash
server_name _;
```

Replace the underscore with your Passbolt domain name:

```bash
server_name passbolt.domain.tld;
```

## Reconfigure Passbolt
