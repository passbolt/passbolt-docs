## Prerequisites

Making regular backups is a critical aspect of managing a Passbolt instance. Because Passbolt stores important information, it is equally important to have a backup strategy in place.

As a Passbolt administrator it is your responsibility to define how often and when to perform backups. Please automate and customize this process to match the needs and policies of your organization.

Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

* Ensure that the backups are taken at intervals that match your usage
* Take these backups off-site, or to another environment than the live one
* Make sure the backup is encrypted and stored in a safe location
* Practice drills and test the backups to make sure they work
