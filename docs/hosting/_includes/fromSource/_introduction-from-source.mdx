## Introduction

This tutorial is distribution agnostic. It details the installation steps at a high level, without
taking into account the specifics related to each and every linux distribution. It is provided for reference only,
to demonstrate that it is possible to install passbolt from source.

:::caution
This is NOT the recommended way to {`${props.type}`} passbolt. You will find guides to install passbolt on your distribution [here](/docs/hosting/install).
You should most likely not attempt this unless you are an advanced administrator with very specific needs in terms of server configuration.
