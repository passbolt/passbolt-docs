### Install or reconfigure Passbolt

If you don’t have Passbolt installed please check on the hosting section for more information on how to install Passbolt on debian.

If you have already installed Passbolt then you want to execute the following command to start the configuration process for SSL:

<CodeBlock>
    {`sudo dpkg-reconfigure passbolt-${props.productName.toLowerCase()}-server`}
</CodeBlock>

You most likely want to say ‘NO’ to the mariadb/mysql setup question and go for the nginx setup
