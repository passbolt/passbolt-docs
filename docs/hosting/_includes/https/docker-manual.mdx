<HTTPSWarning />


## Requirements
  - <a href={`/docs/hosting/install/${props.productName.toLowerCase()}/docker`}>docker setup with docker-compose</a>.



## HTTPS configuration

You need to bind-mount your certificates inside passbolt container to use them.

Create a certs folder and put your certificates there:

<CodeBlock>
    {`mkdir certs
mv /path/to/your/certificate.crt certs/cert.pem
mv /path/to/your/certificate.key certs/key.pem`}
</CodeBlock>

The bind-mount configuration will differ depending which passbolt image you are using.
### Standard images

If you are using standard passbolt image, add your certificates in the volumes definition of the passbolt service and ensure ports are well mapped:

<CodeBlock>
    {`version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    ...
  passbolt:
    ...
    volumes:
      ...
      - ./certs/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt:ro
      - ./certs/key.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.key:ro
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443`}
</CodeBlock>

Ensure your `APP_FULL_BASE_URL` environment variable starts with `https://`
### Non-root images

If you are using non-root images, tagged as non-root, the bind-mount path will be different as well as port mapping:

<CodeBlock>
    {`version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    ...
  passbolt:
    ...
    volumes:
      ...
      - ./certs/cert.pem:/etc/passbolt/certs/certificate.crt:ro
      - ./certs/key.pem:/etc/passbolt/certs/certificate.key:ro
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      - 443:4433`}
</CodeBlock>

Like standard images, ensure your `APP_FULL_BASE_URL` environment variable starts with `https://`
