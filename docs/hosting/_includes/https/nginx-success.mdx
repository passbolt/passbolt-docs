If everything goes fine you should see a final message that points you to finish Passbolt configuration:
<Figure
  src="/img/help/2020/05/debian-package/success.png"
  alt="Success message"
  caption="fig. Success message"
/>


Reload nginx after finish the reconfigure to use the SSL configuration.
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Finally, ensure `fullBaseUrl` value in `/etc/passbolt/passbolt.php` starts with `https://`.

And thatâ€™s it you should be able to reach your server on the domain you specified.
