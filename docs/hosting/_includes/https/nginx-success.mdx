If everything goes fine you should see a final message that points you to finish passbolt configuration:
<Figure
  src="https://help.passbolt.com/assets/img/help/2020/05/debian-package/success.png"
  alt="Success message"
  caption="fig. Success message"
/>


Reload nginx after finish the reconfigure to use the SSL configuration.
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
