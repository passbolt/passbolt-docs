<HTTPSWarning />

If you are reconfiguring Passbolt you most likely want to say **‘NO’** to the mariadb or havaged setup questions and go for the nginx setup
## MariaDB / Nginx / SSL settings

Passbolt {props.productName} RPM package on come with a configuration helper tool to prepare MariaDB, Nginx and SSL settings.

You must prepare your SSL certificates before launching the tool. Be sure to write down the full path to your cert/key combo, as it will be needed in the nginx configuration process.

Please, notice that for security matters we highly recommend to setup SSL to serve Passbolt.

Launch passbolt-configure tool and answer to the questions:

<CodeBlock>
    {`sudo /usr/local/bin/passbolt-configure`}
</CodeBlock>

## Nginx

Please enter the domain name under which Passbolt will run.

:::important[Note]
This hostname will be used as server_name for nginx and as the domain name to register a SSL certificate with let’s encrypt if you don’t have your own SSL certificates.
:::


<CodeBlock>
    {`=========
Hostname: passbolt.domain.tld
=========`}
</CodeBlock>

## SSL configuration

There are 3 choices available for SSL configuration:

  -  manual: Prompts for the path of user uploaded ssl certificates and set up nginx
  -  auto: Will issue a free SSL certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org) and set up nginx
  -  none: Do not setup HTTPS at all

<CodeBlock>
    {`==================
Setting up SSL...
==================
1) manual
2) auto
3) none
#?`}
</CodeBlock>

If you choose 1, you will be prompted for the full path of your certificates:

<CertificateWarning />

<CodeBlock>
    {`Enter the path to the SSL certificate: /path/to/certs/cert.pem
Enter the path to the SSL privkey: /path/to/certs/key.pem`}
</CodeBlock>

Nginx and MariaDB are now on the way to be configured. You will be notified at the end of the process to connect to the Passbolt web interface to finish the configuration.

<CodeBlock>
    {`===============================================================
Installation is almost complete. Please point your browser to
  https://passbolt.domain.tld to complete the process
===============================================================`}
</CodeBlock>

Reload nginx after finish the reconfigure to use the SSL configuration.

<CodeBlock>
    {`sudo systemctl reload nginx`}
</CodeBlock>

:::warning
Finally, ensure `fullBaseUrl` value in `/etc/passbolt/passbolt.php` starts with `https://`.
:::

And that’s it you should be able to reach your server on the domain you specified.
