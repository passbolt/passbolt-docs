## Pre-requisites

For this tutorial, you will need:
- Passbolt installed on an old server
- A new server with Docker

## Backup the existing data

Prior to the migration you will need to backup the existing passbolt instance data. Please refer to [the official backup documentations](/hosting/backup/).

Depending on your SSL configuration you might need to copy the certificate and key from the existing instance.

Don't delete the existing instance yet!

## Prepare the new server
Create a fresh new Passbolt instance on Docker following <Link to={`/docs/hosting/install/${props.productName.toLowerCase()}/docker/`}>this documentation</Link>.

## Migrate the data

### Stop running containers

At this step, you should have a running empty Passbolt instance running on your server. We will now stop it and delete the database volume.

If you have chosen the `docker compose` install, you just have to delete the volumes you created with this command (don't forget the `-v`):

<CodeBlock>
    {`docker compose -f docker-compose-${props.productName.toLowerCase()}.yaml down -v`}
</CodeBlock>

If you have chosen to run docker containers, stop them and delete the database volume:

<CodeBlock>
{`docker stop passbolt-container-name
docker stop passbolt-database-name
docker volume rm passbolt-database-volume-name`}
</CodeBlock>

Of course, replace containers and volume name with your own !

### Restore your database

According to [MariaDB documentation on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb):

> When a container is started for the first time, a new database with the specified name will be created and initialized with the provided configuration variables.
>
> Furthermore, it will execute files with extensions .sh, .sql, .sql.gz, and .sql.xz that are found in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d. Files will be executed in alphabetical order. .sh files without file execute permission are sourced rather than executed.
>
> You can easily populate your mariadb services by mounting a SQL dump into that directory and provide custom images with contributed data. SQL files will be imported by default to the database specified by the MARIADB_DATABASE / MYSQL_DATABASE variable.

This means you just have to mount your database backup file on `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` folder of the database container.

<p>Edit your docker-compose-{props.productName.toLowerCase()}.yaml file and add a volume mount in the db service:</p>

<CodeBlock>
{`volumes:
  - database_volume:/var/lib/mysql
  - ./path/to/your/database/dump.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/dump.sql`}
</CodeBlock>

### Set your GPG server keys fingerprint and email

In the scope of a migration to docker, you need to add 2 environment variables to the passbolt service
related to the GPG server keys fingerprint and email address.

Get them from your backed up keys:

<CodeBlock>
{`$ gpg --show-keys /path/to/serverkey.asc
pub   rsa3072 2022-01-20 [SC]
      43F978AFF88B53F5ABBD12C87D5E40A4C43926ED
uid                      Passbolt default user <passbolt@yourdomain.com>
sub   rsa3072 2022-01-20 [E]`}
</CodeBlock>

In the above output, fingerprint is `43F978AFF88B53F5ABBD12C87D5E40A4C43926ED` and email address is `passbolt@yourdomain.com`.

<p>Add the environment variables in your <i>docker-compose-{props.productName.toLowerCase()}.yaml</i> file (replace with your own values):</p>

```yaml
services:
  passbolt:
    environment:
      PASSBOLT_GPG_SERVER_KEY_FINGERPRINT: "43F978AFF88B53F5ABBD12C87D5E40A4C43926ED"
      PASSBOLT_KEY_EMAIL: "passbolt@yourdomain.com"
```

### Start your containers

You can now start your database and passbolt containers, your database will be restored at the database container start.

### Restore GPG server keys

Copy the GPG you backed up in your container:

```bash
docker cp serverkey_private.asc your-passbolt-container:/etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey_private.asc
docker cp serverkey.asc your-passbolt-container:/etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey.asc
```

Then set correct rights:

```bash
docker run --rm your-passbolt-container chown -R www-data:www-data /etc/passbolt/gpg
docker run --rm your-passbolt-container chmod -R 550 /etc/passbolt/gpg
```

To test if user `www-data` can read the files:

```bash
docker run --rm your-passbolt-container -u www-data cat /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey.asc
docker run --rm your-passbolt-container -u www-data cat /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey_private.asc
```

### That's it

If your passbolt URL has changed, you will have to proceed to the same process than when setting up the browser
extension on a new browser aka, follow the [account recovery](/user/quickstart/browser/setup-on-another-machine/) process.
