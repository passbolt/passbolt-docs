<p> A {props.distributionLabel} package has been created to increase the ease of installing and upgrading Passbolt.</p>

## Pre-requisites

For this tutorial, you will need:
<ul>
    <li>A minimal {props.distributionLabel} {props.distributionVersion} server.</li>
    <li>Passbolt installed with the {props.distributionLabel} install script.</li>
</ul>


## 1. Take down your site

It is generally a good idea to stop running the site prior to the upgrade. This is to avoid having side effects
such as active users corrupting the data in the middle of an upgrade.

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo systemctl stop nginx`}
</CodeBlock>

## 2. Backup your instance

First things first, as this is a sensitive operation a backup of the instance must be performed to prevent any data loss.
You can follow our [backup process](/hosting/backup/).

## 3. Upgrade your system

Passbolt requires PHP 8.2.

<p> A full system upgrade to {props.distributionLabel} {props.distributionVersion} is necessary before installing the Passbolt {props.distributionLabel} package.</p>

{(props.distributionPackage === 'dnf' || props.distributionPackage === 'yum') ? (
<CodeBlock>
    sudo {props.distributionPackage} upgrade
</CodeBlock>
    ) : (
   <div>
    <Link to={props.distributionUpgradeGuide}>Here</Link> is the official {props.distributionLabel} guide to upgrade your system with a step by step tutorial.
   </div>
    )}
</>

## 4. Install the package
