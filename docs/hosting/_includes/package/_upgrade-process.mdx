## Upgrade Passbolt

:::warning
While this documentation provides guidance on upgrading your Passbolt instance from CE to PRO, we highly recommend considering a [migration to a new server](/hosting/migrate/server/). This approach ensures a cleaner transition and avoids potential issues that may persist from your current setup.
:::

### 1. Take down your site
   It is generally a good idea to stop running the site prior to the upgrade. This is to avoid having side effects such as active users corrupting the data in the middle of an upgrade.


<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo systemctl stop nginx`}
</CodeBlock>

### 2. Backup your database
It is recommended to always perform a backup of your Passbolt installation. Please check the [backup article](/hosting/backup/from-packages/)

### 3. Upload your subscription key

You should copy your subscription key to `/etc/passbolt/subscription_key.txt` and ensure the permissions are correct.

<CodeBlock>
    {`sudo chown root:${props.distributionWebUser} /etc/passbolt/subscription_key.txt
sudo chmod 640 /etc/passbolt/subscription_key.txt`}
</CodeBlock>

### 4. Uninstall Passbolt CE

Passbolt CE package should be removed prior to installing Passbolt Pro.
<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo ${props.distributionPackage} remove passbolt-ce-server`}
</CodeBlock>


### 5. Upgrade Passbolt package repository

For easier installation and update tasks Passbolt provides a package repository that you need to setup before you download Passbolt PRO and install it.

__Step 1.__ Download our dependencies installation script:
<CodeBlock>
  {`wget "https://download.passbolt.com/pro/installer/passbolt-repo-setup.pro.sh"`}
</CodeBlock>

__Step 2.__ Download our SHA512SUM for the installation script:
<CodeBlock>
  {`wget https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt-dep-scripts/releases/latest/download/passbolt-pro-SHA512SUM.txt`}
</CodeBlock>

__Step 3.__ Ensure that the script is valid and execute it:
<CodeBlock>
  {`sha512sum -c passbolt-pro-SHA512SUM.txt && sudo bash ./passbolt-repo-setup.pro.sh  --passbolt-migrate  || echo "Bad checksum. Aborting" && rm -f passbolt-repo-setup.pro.sh`}
</CodeBlock>

### 6. Install Passbolt PRO

Now you can install the Passbolt Pro package.
<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo ${props.distributionPackage} install passbolt-pro-server`}
</CodeBlock>

<>
  {props.distributionPackage == 'apt' && (
    <div>
      <p>As you have already configured Passbolt CE, and Passbolt Pro relies on the same configuration, you should reply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>No</b> for MariaDB configuration</li>
        <li><b>No</b> to NGINX configuration</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )}
</>

### 7. Migrate the data
Once the package installed, run the following command to migrate the data to Passbolt Pro:

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo -H -u ${props.distributionWebUser} /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt migrate"`}
</CodeBlock>

### 8. Clear the cache
Make sure you clear the application cache, to make sure any changes in the database structure are reflected in model cache files:

<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo -H -u ${props.distributionWebUser} /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake cache clear_all"`}
</CodeBlock>

### 9. Ensure you don’t have duplicate cron jobs
As you are upgrading from CE to Pro you will need to make sure you don’t have duplicate cronjobs.

You can do this by checking `/etc/cron.d/`

You may see:

<pre className="prism-code language-bash">
  <code>
    {`/etc/cron.d/passbolt-ce-server
/etc/cron.d/passbolt-pro-server`}
  </code>
</pre>

If this is the case you’ll want to run:

<CodeBlock>
  {`rm /etc/cron.d/passbolt-ce-server`}
</CodeBlock>

As this will clear out the no longer needed CE job to send emails. If you leave this you may experience receiving duplicate emails.

The other regularly occurring job which you can remove will be under `/etc/logrotate.d/`

You may see:

<pre className="prism-code language-bash">
  <code>
    {`/etc/logrotate.d/passbolt-ce-server
/etc/logrotate.d/passbolt-pro-server`}
  </code>
</pre>

If this is the case you'll want to run:

<CodeBlock>
  {`rm /etc/logrotate.d/passbolt-ce-server`}
</CodeBlock>

This will clean up the no longer needed log rotation job.

### 10. Bring your site back online
Almost done:
<CodeBlock>
  {`sudo systemctl start nginx`}
</CodeBlock>
