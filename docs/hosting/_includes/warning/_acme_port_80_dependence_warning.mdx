The ACME challenge requires port 80 to be open and accessible from the internet. Some administrators disable HTTP traffic on port 80 for security reasons, but this will prevent TLS (SSL) certificate generation and renewal. Ensure port 80 is open in your firewall and not blocked by your hosting provider.
