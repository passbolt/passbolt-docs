:::caution
Installing Passbolt on Kubernetes with our Helm chart is considered to be a very advanced installation method. If you are not very comfortable and familiar with Kubernetes we strongly recommend that you install via one of our other methods.

:::danger[Important]
The current chart uses Bitnami dependencies. [The free useage of these is ending](https://community.broadcom.com/tanzu/blogs/beltran-rueda-borrego/2025/08/18/how-to-prepare-for-the-bitnami-changes-coming-soon?CommunityKey=56a49fa1-c592-460c-aa05-019446f8102f) and the legacy charts & images will be in use for the meantime. We'll be transitioning away from these in the future. We do not recommend using the legacy images in production and instead encourage you to use a different solution of your choice for these images.
