:::danger[WARNING]
Configuring database is only intended for fresh installations. Do not configure it on an existing installation, as it's likely going to cause system instability or break functionality.
:::

To configure your fresh installation with Postgres or MariaDB, it's important to consider the specifics of your environment. Different setups require distinct steps to ensure a smooth and secure configuration process.

Select the appropriate guide below to configure your database based on your distribution method:
- [MariaDB](/hosting/configure/database/configure-database/mariadb)
- [Postgres](/hosting/configure/database/configure-database/postgres)
