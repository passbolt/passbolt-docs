## Introduction

To use **LDAPS**, your LDAP server must present a valid TLS certificate to the client â€” in this case, the **Passbolt server**. The certificate must also be **trusted by Passbolt**.

There are two common certificate setups:

---

### Public Certificate Authority (CA)

If your LDAP server uses a TLS certificate from a public CA (e.g., [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)), the certificate is usually trusted by Passbolt automatically.

> âœ… No extra configuration is typically required.

---

### Private CA or Self-Signed Certificate

In many on-premises environments, LDAP runs on a private network with self-signed or privately issued certificates.

If your LDAP server does not present a **certificate chain** (i.e., missing CA), you must manually upload the **CA certificate** to the Passbolt server.

> ðŸ’¡ Passbolt provides an official [certificate bundler tool](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt-ldap-certificate-bundler) to simplify retrieving and formatting certificates from LDAPS servers.

## Configure Passbolt to Trust a Private LDAPS Certificate

### Step 1: Ping the Server

First, confirm basic connectivity:

```bash
ping your_ldap_server.com
```

- If ping fails, check or add the IP in `/etc/hosts`
- If ping works, proceed to test LDAPS with `ldapsearch`

---

### Step 2: Test LDAPS with ldapsearch

:::warning
Run the command as the web server user:  
**`www-data`** (Debian/Ubuntu), **`wwwrun`** (OpenSUSE), or **`nginx`** (RHEL-based).
:::

```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash -c 'ldapsearch -x -D "username" -W -H ldaps://your_ldap_server.com -b "dc=domain,dc=com" -d 9' www-data
```

Replace:
- `username`
- `your_ldap_server.com`
- `domain`, `com`

#### Example of a certificate trust failure:

```bash
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)
```

> If you see this error, it's likely a trust issue with the LDAPS certificate.

---

### Step 3: Download a Certificate Chain

Use our official utility to retrieve and bundle LDAPS certificates:  
ðŸ”— [passbolt/passbolt-ldap-certificate-bundler](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt-ldap-certificate-bundler)

#### Quick Setup:
Ensure you have any version of **Python 3** installed in your environment. The **activate** step is to avoid polluting your python environment with unecessary pacakges.
Python _virtual environment_ (`venv`) folders keep dependencies separate from the system Python and other projects, so you donâ€™t get version conflicts, and can delete the `venv` folder when you're finished with it.
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt-ldap-certificate-bundler.git
cd passbolt-ldap-certificate-bundler

# Set up the environment
chmod +x setup_python_env.sh
./setup_python_env.sh

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the tool to get the certificate chain
python3 ldaps_cert_chain_retriever.py --server your.ldaps.server > /etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt

# Set proper permissions
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt
```

#### Docker Option:

If you prefer using Docker:

```bash
# Using the provided Makefile
make build
make save SERVER=your.ldaps.server

# Manual Docker commands
docker build -t ldaps-cert-tool .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/out ldaps-cert-tool --server your.ldaps.server --output /out/ldaps_bundle.crt
```

The utility automatically handles:
- Certificate chain retrieval
- Self-signed certificates
- Chain validation
- Proper formatting for Passbolt

---

### Step 4: Configure Certificate Trust

#### Option 1: Via `passbolt.php`

```php
// config/passbolt.php
'plugins' => [
  'directorySync' => [
    'security' => [
      'sslCustomOptions' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'verifyPeer' => true,
        'cadir' => '/etc/ssl/certs',
        'cafile' => '/etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt',
      ],
    ],
  ],
]
```

#### Option 2: Via Environment Variables

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_ENABLED=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_VERIFY_PEER=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_CADIR="/etc/ssl/certs"
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_CAFILE="/etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt"
```

:::info
Use either the Passbolt config OR `ldap.conf` (below), **not both**.
:::

---

### (Deprecated) Option: Use `ldap.conf`

On Debian:

```bash
nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
```

Add or update:

```bash
TLS_CACERT /etc/ssl/certs/ldaps_bundle.crt
```

---

## Optional: Disable Certificate Verification (Test Only)

:::warning
This is insecure and should only be used temporarily for testing. It exposes you to MITM attacks.
:::

#### Option 1: Via `passbolt.php`

```php
// config/passbolt.php
'plugins' => [
  'directorySync' => [
    'security' => [
      'sslCustomOptions' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'verifyPeer' => false,
      ],
    ],
  ],
]
```

#### Option 2: Via Environment Variables

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_ENABLED=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_VERIFY_PEER=false
```

#### Option 3: Via `ldap.conf` (deprecated)

```bash
nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
```

Add:

```bash
TLS_REQCERT never
```

---

### Final Step: Re-Test with ldapsearch

Re-run the ldapsearch command from Step 2.  
If the certificate issue is resolved, the connection should succeed. You can now return to Passbolt and test the sync.

## Looking for More Advanced Scenarios?

This page covers the essentials for setting up and troubleshooting LDAPS in a typical environment.  
However, if you're dealing with:

- edge cases like multi-domain forests,
- sync behavior involving deleted users or group permissions,
- ignored entries, pagination issues, or memory constraints during syncs,

then you should refer to the dedicated page on advanced topics:

ðŸ‘‰ [Advanced Directory Options](/admin/user-provisioning/users-directory/advanced-directory-options/)

That page includes deeper coverage of sync error messages, directory-specific quirks, and diagnostics for large-scale or complex LDAP environments. We maintain that page as the single source of truth for advanced directory provisioning to avoid duplicating technical logic across guides.
