### Requirements

In order to follow this procedure, ensure you meet with the following minimum requirements:

- An access to a linux terminal machine
- The OpenPGP package installed on the linux machine
- The OpenPGP key to generate requirements: Algorithm, strength …

### Generate a new OpenPGP key pair

:::caution[Passphrase or no?]
Whether or not you need to set a passphrase will depend on why you are making this keypair.

**Organization Account Recovery**: In this case you want to set a passphrase.

**Server GPG keys**: In this case you do not want to set a passphrase.
:::

Execute the following command to generate a new OpenPGP key pair.

<CodeBlock>
  {'gpg --full-generate-key'}
</CodeBlock>

This command will run an interactive wizard that will help you define the key settings:

1. Select the key type, by instance: RSA.
2. If RSA was chosen, select the keysize, by instance for a strong key: 3072.
3. Select the expiration time, by instance for “no expiry”: 0. Note that key expiration is not well handled by Passbolt, set an expiration date only if you know what you are doing.
4. Confirm the key type information.
5. Enter a name, by instance: Ada Lovelace.
6. Enter an email, by instance: ada.lovelace@mydomain.tld.
7. Enter a comment, it is optional. It will only help you to identify a key in the keyring if similar name or email chosen.
8. Confirm the key meta information.
9. If you are creating an Organization Account Recovery key pair set a passphrase, if this is for the server GPG key pair do not set a passphrase

Once the key generated, the key will be stored in the keyring of the user you authenticated with and OpenPGP will output the details of the newly generated key.

```bash
public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa3072 2022-08-04 [SC]
      F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A
uid                      Ada Lovelace <ada.lovelace@mydomain.tld>
sub   rsa3072 2022-07-28 [E]
```

The output contains a 40 characters long identifier (`F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A`) that represents the key fingerprint, note it down, it will be useful later to identify the key in the keyring.

### Export an OpenPGP key pair
#### Export an OpenPGP public key
Execute the following command to export a public key having `F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A` as fingerprint from the OpenPGP keyring into a file in armor format.

<CodeBlock>
  {`gpg --armor --export F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A > public.key`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Export an OpenPGP private key

Execute the following command to export a private key having `F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A` as fingerprint from the OpenPGP keyring into a file in armor format.

<CodeBlock>
  {`gpg --armor --export-secret-keys F5B94A730D636A18815046C1408B779FE1951A9A > private.key`}
</CodeBlock>
