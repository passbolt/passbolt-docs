## Introduction

This page is intended to give you the resources to set up NTP(or suitable equivalent) on the main distrobutions that we support. NTP is important for two main reasons with Passbolt. The first is in regards to GPG authentication. The other area where this becomes important is if you have MFA enabled as if the server and user device time get out of sync the codes will not work.
## Ubuntu

[Official Ubuntu Documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/use-timedatectl-and-timesyncd)

Ubuntu uses chrony for time synchronization. This package is not installed by default so you’ll need to install it.

You can check that your server doesn’t have this enabled by running the following:

`timedatectl status`

The output should look something like the following:
```bash
               Local time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:53 UTC
           Universal time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:53 UTC
                 RTC time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:52
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: no
              NTP service: inactive
          RTC in local TZ: no
```
The two most important lines here being:
```bash
System clock synchronized: no
              NTP service: inactive
```
To install chrony you’ll need to run this command:

```bash
sudo apt install chrony
```

You can configure which time servers you want to use by editing `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf`

After you are done editing this file run the following to restart chrony

```bash
sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
```

To ensure this is running correctly you can once again run:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

Your output should now be something like:
```bash
               Local time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40 UTC
           Universal time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40 UTC
                 RTC time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```
The important lines are:
```bash
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
```
If only one of these has changed try running timedatectl status after another minute or two to give it time to be fully correct. Once those are both correct, congratulations you’ve gotten NTP correctly set up!
## Debian

[Official Debian Documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/NTP)

A fresh Debian installation should already be properly configured for this. You can confirm this by running:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

The output should be something like this:
```bash
               Local time: Tue 2022-12-06 14:30:52 UTC
           Universal time: Tue 2022-12-06 14:30:52 UTC
                 RTC time: Tue 2022-12-06 14:30:53
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```
The important lines are:
```bash
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
```
## RedHat

[Official RedHat Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-configuring_ntp_using_ntpd)

On Red Hat Entreprise Linux, you have two choices in terms of NTP installation chrony which is installed by default on some version of Red Hat Entreprise Linux 7 or ntpd.

Chrony should be considered as best match for the systems which are frequently suspended or otherwise intermittently disconnected from a network.

The NTP daemon (ntpd) should be considered for systems which are normally kept permanently on.
### Install chrony on RedHat

As mentionned previously, chrony suite is installed by default on some versions of Red Hat Entreprise Linux 7, to ensure that it is, run the following command as root:

```bash
yum install chrony
```bash

The default location for the chrony daemon is `/usr/sbin/chronyd`. The command line utility will be installed to `/usr/bin/chronyc`.

To check the status of chrony, issue the following command:

```bash
systemctl status chronyd
```

The output should be something like this:
```bash
chronyd.service - NTP client/server
  Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.service; enabled)
  Active: active (running) since Wed 2013-06-12 22:23:16 CEST; 11h ago
```
If that is not the case, in order to start chrony, issue the following command as root:

```bash
systemctl start chronyd
```

To ensure chrony starts automatically at system start, issue the following command as root:

```bash
systemctl enable chronyd
```

To check if chrony is synchronized, make use of the tracking command:
```bash
chronyc tracking
```

The output should be something like this:
```bash
Reference ID  : CB00710F (foo.example.net)
Stratum     : 3
Ref time (UTC) : Fri Jan 27 09:49:17 2017
System time   : 0.000006523 seconds slow of NTP time
Last offset   : -0.000006747 seconds
RMS offset   : 0.000035822 seconds
Frequency    : 3.225 ppm slow
Residual freq  : 0.000 ppm
Skew      : 0.129 ppm
Root delay   : 0.013639022 seconds
Root dispersion : 0.001100737 seconds
Update interval : 64.2 seconds
Leap status   : Normal
```
### Install ntpd on RedHat

In order to use ntpd the default user space daemon, chrony, must be stopped and disable. Issue the following commands as root:
```bash
systemctl stop chronyd
```

To prevent it restarting at system start, issue the following command as root:
```bash
systemctl disable chronyd
```

To check the status of chronyd, issue the following command:
```bash
systemctl status chronyd
```

To check if ntpd is installed and install it if not, enter the following command as root:
```bash
yum install ntp
```

To enable ntpd at system start, enter the following command as root:
```bash
systemctl enable ntpd
```

To check if ntpd is running and configured to run at system start, issue the following command:
```bash
systemctl status ntpd
```

To obtain a brief status report from ntpd, issue the following command:
```bash
ntpstat
```

The output should be something like this:
```bash
synchronised to NTP server (10.5.26.10) at stratum 2
  time correct to within 52 ms
  polling server every 1024 s
```
## OpenSUSE

[Official OpenSUSE Documentation](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book-reference/cha-ntp.html)

To configure NTP on OpenSUSE we will need YaST. YaST is featured in the OpenSUSE Linux distribution.

To run yast you will need to run this command:
```bash
sux yast2
```

Once it is running, specify when to start the network time protocol service:
  -  Only manually

Start the Network Time Protocol service manually
  -  Synchronize without Daemon

Set the system time periodically without a permanently running Network Time Protocol service. You can set the Interval of the Synchronization in Minutes.
  -  Now and on boot

Start the Network Time Protocol service automatically when the system is booting. This setting is recommended.

After this step, you will need to specify the type of configuration source. In the Configuration Source drop-down box, select either Dynamic or Static. Set Static if your server uses only a fixed set of (public) NTP servers. If your internal network offers NTP servers via DHCP, pick Dynamic.

You need to configure time servers. Time servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the NTP Configuration window. Modify this list as needed by clicking Add, Edit, and Delete.

After you clicked Add to add a new time server in the address field, type the URL of the time server or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine time (for example, europe.pool.ntp.org).

After URL is complete, click on Test to verify that it points to a valid time source.

You can active Quick initial Sync to speed up the time synchronization by sending more request at the Network Time Protocol service start or you can active Start Offline to speed up the boot time on systems that start the Network Time Protocol service automatically and may not have an internet connection at boot time.

Now that we have configured Network Time Protocol with YaST we need to restart and enable chrony with:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart chronyd.service
sudo systemctl enable chronyd.service
```
## Oracle Linux

[Official Oracle Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26996_01/E18548/html/manager_ntpconfig.html)

To configure Network Time Protocol On Oracle you need to install the NTP package:

```bash
yum install ntp
```

Once NTP is installed, you will need to start the service and set it to launch automatically upon boot:
```bash
service ntpd start
chkconfig ntpd on
```
You can check upstream synchronization with the ntpq command:

`ntpq -p`

The output should be something like this:
```bash
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================

```
## Fedora

[Official Fedora Documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide)

The chrony suite is installed by default on some versions of Fedora, but you have two choices the other one being ntpd.

Chrony should be considered as best match for the systems which are frequently suspended or otherwise intermittently disconnected from a network.

The NTP daemon (ntpd) should be considered for systems which are normally kept permanently on.

```bash
dnf install ntp
```

To enable ntpd at system start, enter the following command as root:
```bash
systemctl enable ntpd
```

To check if ntpd is running and configured to run at system start, issue the following command:

## Docker

Docker's time is set via the host's time. You will need to follow the relevant instructions to configure NTP for the server hosting your Docker container.
