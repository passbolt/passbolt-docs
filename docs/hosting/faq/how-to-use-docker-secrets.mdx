This page should give you the information necessary to successfully use [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) with your Passbolt installation.

## Supported environment variables

List of [environment variables](/hosting/configure/https/) that can be received as Docker secret and the matching Docker secret path environment variable:
| PASSBOLT ENV VAR                         | DOCKER SECRET ENV VAR                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD             | DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE                                         |
| DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_HOST                 | DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_HOST_FILE                                             |
| DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_USERNAME             | DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_USERNAME_FILE                                         |
| DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_DATABASE             | DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_DATABASE_FILE                                         |

## Supported secret files

List of file that contains secret data and the matching Docker secret path environment variable:
| FILE PATH                                |  DOCKER SECRET ENV VAR                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey.asc           | PASSBOLT_GPG_SERVER_KEY_PUBLIC_FILE                                       |
| /etc/passbolt/gpg/serverkey_private.asc  | PASSBOLT_GPG_SERVER_KEY_PRIVATE_FILE                                      |
| /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt           | PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE                                             |
| /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.key           | PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_KEY_FILE                                              |

## Examples
### Inject DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD variable usign Docker secrets

Following the Docker secrets documentation for Docker compose we have the following docker-compose.yaml example:
```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
     secrets:
       - db_password
     ...

secrets:
   db_password:
     file: db_password.txt
```
In this example we want to inject the contents of `db_password.txt` in the `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable inside the Passbolt container.

To do so we create the secret and call it db_password in this snippet:
```yaml
secrets:
   db_password:
     file: db_password.txt
```
Once we have this, we use this secret on the Passbolt service:
```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     secrets:
       - db_password
     ...
```
Finally, we have to check which environment variable we have to set in order to get the contents of the secret file in the `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` var. So we check in the Supported environment variables section to get the correct variable (`DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` in this case) and set it on the Passbolt container environment with the path that points to the secret name:
```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
```
### Inject /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem file using Docker secrets
```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE: /run/secrets/ssl_cert
     secrets:
       - ssl_cert
     ...

secrets:
   ssl_cert:
     file: ssl_cert.pem
```
In this example we want to inject the contents of `ssl_cert.pem` in the `/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem` file inside the Passbolt container.

To do so, we create a Docker secret and call it ssl_cert with the contents of `ssl_cert.pem`:
```yaml
secrets:
   ssl_cert:
     file: ssl_cert.pem
```
Then we inject the secret in the Passbolt service:
```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     secrets:
       - ssl_cert
     ...
```
And finally, we go to the supported secret files section to get which environment variable is the one that points to the path I want to fill (`PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE` which points to `/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt`):
```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE: /run/secrets/ssl_cert
```
### Create secret outside of compose file

You can also create secrets directly so that you don’t have to retain the file with the secret. This example will show you how to do that.

The first step here is to create the secret:

`docker secret create gpg-public public.key`

You will then need to modify your compose file to designate this as an external secret:
```yaml
secrets:
   gpg-public:
     external: true
```
Finally you will need to make sure this secret is used by the Passbolt service:
```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_GPG_SERVER_KEY_PUBLIC_FILE: /run/secrets/gpg-public
     secrets:
       - gpg-public
     ...
```
