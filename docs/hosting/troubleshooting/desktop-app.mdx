Passbolt Windows Application is something that has been a lot requested from the community, this page is dedicated to troubleshoot the potential errors that can happen throughout the configuration process.

## Account-Kit
The account kit is needed in order to configure the Windows application, this can be downloaded from *Profile > Desktop app setup > Download your account kit*

## Certificates
:::info[IMPORTANT]
The Windows application requires HTTPS to work.
:::

### Which certificate are you using?

#### Let's Encrypt
There is usually no server issues with a certificate issued by rootCA (here, Let's Encrypt), you should be able to upload the account kit and proceed further without any issues.

#### Self-signed certificate
If you've chose to use a self-signed certificate, you need to trust it on your OS, but before proceeding, you have to download the certificate.


- Navigate to the instance URL and click on "Unsecure connexion"

  }

- Click on the "Show certificate" Icon, usually where it is written "Certificate is not valid"

- Make sure that you are setting the extension file to ".cer"

  }
  alt={'Set the file extension to .cer'}
  caption={'fig. Set the file extension to .cer'}
/>


Now that the file has been downloaded:
- Double-click on the file
- Install Certificate
- Choose Local Machine (otherwise it will ask to do it every two weeks)
  - Click "Yes"
- Place all certificate in the following store
- Browse the folder path
  - Trusted Root Certification Authorities
- Click on "Finish"

That's it! You should not face any errors while configuring the Windows application and importing your account kit.

## Server error
If after following the steps above, it is not working, you might be encountering a server internal error.

You may have to manually clear the Windows credentials manager.

- Search for "Credentials Manager"
- Go to "Web Credentials"
  - It should have only three web credentials object
    - Delete them
- Proceed again to the installation of the certificate

### Still not working?

If you run into any issues, this is usually related to one of these three behaviour.

- There is still cache data in *Credentials Manager > Web Credentials* on Windows
  - Delete the three objects inside
- The folder path is wrong when installing the certificate
  - The certificate should be imported in **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
- The certificate hasn't been properly imported
  - You have to re-download the certificate and trust the certificate again.

## MSIX Bundle

While installing the windows application through our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt-windows/releases), it is possible to encounter some issues. Here is listed the one we've seen so far.

### Version not supported
Before going deeper in the investigation, we recommend double-checking that you are using a [supported version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/supported-platforms). Windows describe the different support for the different versions of windows.

### Code 0x80070005

The error code **0x80070005** generally signals a permissions issue or insufficient administrative privileges when attempting to install an MSIX bundle or application package.

1. Run as Administrator
2. Disable Antivirus or Security Software
3. Adjust User Account Control (UAC)

You can read more about it [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/i-cant-install-msixbundle-file/a2dc03f8-26be-4205-be26-c6297761e965).

### Windows 10 LTSC/LTSB
In the LTSC systems, App Installer and Microsoft Store are not available. One solution is to install the [winget package](https://medium.com/@bonguides25/how-to-fix-windows-cant-open-this-type-of-file-msixbundle-068da587431b). It will install the missing AppX Desktop Deployment automatically.

The other solution would be to enable it into the `service.msc`
1. Press the Windows Key + S and type in services.msc.
2. Find the Microsoft Store Install Service and double-click,
3. If Disabled, change it to Automatic, click Start and click OK.

If it is still not working
1. Press the windows key + R and type in msconfig
2. Find the services tab and search Microsoft Store Install Service
3. Enable it

### Install the bundle with the command line
Some systems do not allow the users to install the application by clicking on it. The workaround is to go through the terminal, run it as administrator and run the following command:

<CodeBlock>
  {`Add-AppxPackage -Path C:\\Path\\App-Package.msixbundle`}
</CodeBlock>
