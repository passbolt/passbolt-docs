## The importance of the installation method

There are three main types of installations for Passbolt, and that's what you need to know before running one of these commands as they may not work for each installation.

  -  Package installation (Debian, Ubuntu, OracleLinux, and so on.)
  -  From source
  -  Docker

With package installation, the files will be split into two different directories, `/etc/passbolt` for the configuration files and `/usr/share/php/passbolt` for every other files and the CakePHP CLI.

If you did a from source installation, the whole directory will be in `/var/www/passbolt`.

If you are running Docker, please, refer to the [Troubleshooting Docker](/hosting/troubleshooting/docker/) guide as all is explained there.

If you are running Helm, please, refer to the [Troubleshooting Helm](/hosting/troubleshooting/helm/) guide as all is explained there.


## API

:::info Docker environment variables
Before running the cake tools inside docker containers, ensure you've imported the environment variables into your terminal session.

`$ source /etc/environment`
:::
### Healthcheck

The healthcheck is used to check whether the Passbolt system is running as expected. It evaluates various aspects of the system to ensure that all components are working properly and configured correctly. It provides a detailed report about important information such as the gpg configuration, the ssl access, database configuration, etc.

    **Package Installation**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt healthcheck" www-data
    ```

    **From source**
     ```bash
     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt healthcheck" www-data
     ```

### Datacheck

The datacheck is a great tool as it aims to have a look at the data integrity for gpg keys, authentication tokens, groups, resources, etc.

    **Package Installation**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt datacheck" www-data
    ```

    **From source**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt datacheck" www-data
    ```

<Webserverprotip />

### Status Report

The status report is in most case the best alternative if you need to gather information from the healthcheck, datacheck, do a cleanup dry-run and retrieve the server logs.

On top of executing the healthcheck, datacheck and retrieving the server logs one after the other, it also gives important information about the system itself such as the passbolt edition and version, the version of CakePHP and PHP, composer version etc.

    **Package Installation**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/status-report" www-data
    ```

    **From source**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/var/www/passbolt/bin/status-report" www-data
    ```

<Webserverprotip />

### Server logs

The server logs contains mostly error and warnings such as bad request, invalid requests, applications errors, etc.

    **Package Installation**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "cat /var/log/passbolt/error.log" www-data
    ```

    **From source**
    ```bash
    sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "cat /var/www/passbolt/logs/error.log" www-data
    ```
