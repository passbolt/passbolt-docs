It is recommended that users pull the tags pointing to specific passbolt versions when running in environments other than testing.

To update passbolt, you would just need to change the image tag in your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
 image: passbolt/passbolt:<IMAGE_TAG>
``` 
Then relaunch your docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
By doing this:

a new passbolt docker image will be pulled and a new container created
your passbolt database schema will be updated
