Sharing passwords using groups is already possible in passbolt and can help organise the passwords. It is often not enough for small teams or users with a lot of passwords, who often need another way to organise their data.

## How are tags different than categories?
The major difference between categories and tags is that, in most systems using folders, a given item only belongs to one folder. Inversely, when tagging, one item can be linked to many tags. Also while it is possible to have a hierarchical tag structure it is also less common.
