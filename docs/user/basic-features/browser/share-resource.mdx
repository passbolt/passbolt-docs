##  What are the different permissions?

Passbolt offers three permissions at the resource or folder level:

* <b>Owner:</b> can manage share settings, delete, update, read.
* <b>Update:</b> can update the record and delete.
* <b>Read:</b> can only read and use the password metadata and secret.

:::warning
A User with <b>Update</b> right is able to delete a resource. The main difference between <b>Owner</b> and <b>Update</b>
right is the ability for the <b>Owner</b> to share a resource.
