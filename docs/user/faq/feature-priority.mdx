Furthermore, we recognize the pivotal role of our financial contributors and supporters. Their generous support
accelerates our development process, enabling us to bring new functionalities to life more swiftly.

Priority Considerations:
- <strong>Security issues</strong> whether it affects confidentiality or availability.
- <strong>Serious bugs</strong> that prevent a significant part of the user base to use the tool core functionalities.
- <strong>Maintenance tasks</strong> of underlying software components and fixes technical debt.
- <strong>New functionalities</strong> and feature improvements.

We prioritize the security and integrity of our platform above all else. Security vulnerabilities and bug fixes
are addressed with the utmost urgency, to provide a safe and reliable environment for everyone.

Additionally, the development team proactively manages the maintenance and upgrades of our core libraries and frameworks.
This proactive stance on maintenance ensures the long-term sustainability and performance of the platform.
