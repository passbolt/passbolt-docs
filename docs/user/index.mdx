and can use all the password management features provided by Passbolt to securely store and share passwords.

An admin also has additional responsibilities, such as managing user access, like configuring security
and user interface settings, and overseeing the overall administration of the Passbolt instance, ensuring smooth operation and
adherence to your organizational policies.
