## What is the difference between admins and users?
Passbolt makes a distinction between **user** and **admin** roles. Users are invited by administrators to join an organization
and can use all the password management features provided by Passbolt to securely store and share passwords.

An admin also has additional responsibilities, such as managing user access, like configuring security
and user interface settings, and overseeing the overall administration of the Passbolt instance, ensuring smooth operation and
adherence to your organizational policies.

Because of Passbolt multiple configuration options, your experience as an end user may vary according to your
organization's policy. If you are not sure why you cannot perform an action please contact your admin.
