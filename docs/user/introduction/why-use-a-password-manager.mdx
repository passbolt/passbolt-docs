A password manager is essential for implementing security best-practices and minimizing risks for organizations.
By adopting Passbolt, your team can effectively prevent the widespread reuse of passwords across multiple
systems, ensuring stronger and more secure credentials without the burden of memorization.

Moreover, it simplifies the process of regularly rotating passwords, promoting proactive security measures such as
changing passwords whenever a person leaves your organisation or a team. Additionally it facilitates seamless
onboarding for new team members by granting immediate access to necessary credentials.

Furthermore, having credential centralization prevents loss of vital information, enhancing overall security
and productivity within the organization, reducing the need to perform account recovery.
