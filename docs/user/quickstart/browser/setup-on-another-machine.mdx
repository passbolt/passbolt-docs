:::warning
You need your recovery kit (private key and passphrase) to setup Passbolt on a new browser.
:::

The recovery kit can be used if you are setting up Passbolt on a new machine, for example if you lost, upgraded or reinstalled
the previous one. This procedure can also be used to configure Passbolt on an additional machine, or another browser,
or another browser profile.

## Requirements

You can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:

- You are in possession of a valid user account (you have completed the setup, and you are not suspended);
- You are in possession of your recovery kit, it contains a copy of the private key associated to your account;
- You remember your passphrase.

If you lost your recovery kit or your passphrase and you subscribed to the account recovery program, checkout this [documentation](/user/quickstart/browser/admin-assisted-recovery/).


## Procedure

**Step 1.** In order to recover you will need to go to your domain URL and add `/recover` at the end of the url,
for example `https://yourpassbolt.com/recover`.
