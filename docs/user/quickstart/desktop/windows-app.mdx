### How can I reset my Windows application

To unlink an existing account and set up a new one, first download the current entries from the Credentials Manager. To do this, use the search bar to find `Credential Manager` and select it.

To remove an existing account from the application, delete the `account-metadata` and `account-secret` entries. This action will reset the application, enabling you to import a new account.

### Can I Use Windows Hello?
