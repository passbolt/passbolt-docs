# Using Windows App

## Prerequisites

:::warning
**Important:** The Windows application is currently in  **BETA**  mode. To use it, you need to enable the ‘desktop’ feature flag. This will allow all your users to access and configure the Passbolt desktop application from their user profiles
:::

This feature flag can be enabled through different methods:

* Docker: Set the environment variable  `PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DESKTOP_ENABLED`  to true.  
* Configuration File: In  `/etc/passbolt/passbolt.php`, add the following section:
    

```php title="/etc/passbolt/passbolt.php"
return [
  "passbolt" => [
    "plugins" => [
      "desktop" => [
        "enabled" => true
      ]
    ]
  ]
];
```

## How to download and install the application

Access the application by clicking on the link in your profile space. This  [link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PFXS2WVKVPB?hl=en-US&gl=US)  will redirect you to the Windows Store.

## Import an existing passbolt account

To configure your account in the desktop application, you must transfer your private key from the browser extension to the desktop application.

### Getting started

After installing the application, you will see instructions on how to download your account kit via the web application. By clicking the ‘Next’ button, you will be guided to the process for uploading your account kit.

### Verify account kit

Once the account kit is successfully uploaded, your account information, including your username and the URL of the Passbolt server, will be displayed on the screen.

Please review this information carefully before proceeding. If you find any discrepancies, you can return to the upload screen by clicking on `Import another account`.

Once your passphrase is validated, the setup of your account will be complete, and you will be able to access the password workspace.

### How can I reset my windows application

To unlink an existing account and set up a new one, first download the current entries from the Credentials Manager. To do this, use the search bar to find `Credential Manager` and select it.

To remove an existing account from the application, delete the `account-metadata` and `account-secret` entries. This action will reset the application, enabling you to import a new account.

### Can I Use Windows Hello?

Currently, we do not support Windows Hello due to certain security concerns that are under review. We are investigating the most secure implementation methods and will inform you as soon as a plan is established.
