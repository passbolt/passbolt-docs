## Prerequisites

Before setting up the passbolt mobile app on iOS, ensure you have:

- A passbolt account already configured in your browser
- Your passbolt server URL

:::warning
passbolt mobile apps require HTTPS to function. If you're using a self-signed certificate, you'll need to import it to your device first. See our [TLS (SSL) certificate import guide](/hosting/faq/how-to-import-ssl-certificate-on-mobile-application/) for detailed instructions.
:::

## Download and Install

Scan the QR code below to download the passbolt app from the iOS App Store, or search for "passbolt" in the App Store on your device.

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Launch the App

Open the passbolt app and tap "Get Started" to begin the setup process.

### Step 2: Choose Setup Option

You'll be presented with two options:

- **"Connect to an existing account"** - If you already have a passbolt account
- **"I don't have an account"** - If you need to create a new account

:::warning
It is currently not possible to create an account using the mobile app. First you will need to create an account using your desktop browser extension.
:::

### Step 3: Connect to Existing Account

If you have an existing account, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in using the browser extension** on your desktop
2. **Go to the profile page** in your browser
3. **Go to the mobile section** in your profile
4. **Scan the QR codes** displayed on the screen

### Step 4: Scan QR Code

1. In the passbolt mobile app, tap **"Scan QR code"**
2. Point your camera at the QR code displayed in your browser
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection

## Configure Autofill

For autofill setup and configuration, see our autofill documentation.

## Disable Built-in Password Manager

To avoid conflicts, disable iOS's built-in password manager. See our [guide on disabling built-in password managers](/user/faq/disable-built-in-password-manager/).

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Issues

- Ensure your server uses HTTPS
- For self-signed certificates, import the certificate to your device
- Check our [TLS (SSL) certificate troubleshooting guide](/hosting/faq/how-to-import-ssl-certificate-on-mobile-application/)

### Autofill Not Working

If autofill is not working properly, ensure that:
- The passbolt autofill service is enabled in your device settings
- You have granted necessary permissions to the passbolt app
- Your device's built-in password manager is disabled
